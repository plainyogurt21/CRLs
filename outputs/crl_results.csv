"naloxone HCl, 4 mg nasal spray",NDA 219045,2024-10-21,"The higher systemic exposure of the proposed product compared to approved naloxone products is a safety concern, potentially increasing the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal. The submitted safety data is inadequate to address these risks in a nonprescription setting, and labeling challenges exist in communicating these differences to consumers.",safety,"The sponsor must establish the safety of the proposed product's higher systemic exposure for consumers in the nonprescription setting, potentially through product reformulation to achieve lower systemic exposure or by providing adequate clinical safety data and appropriate labeling to address the increased risks. This may include studies on higher-exposure naloxone formulations in opioid-dependent individuals and ensuring adequate comprehension of product labeling.",https://github.com/plainyogurt21/CRLs/blob/main/unapproved_CRLs/CRL_NDA219045_20241021.pdf
