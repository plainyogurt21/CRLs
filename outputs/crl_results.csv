If relying on a single trial plus confirmatory evidence, a well-designed and adequately powered nonclinical efficacy study in an animal model of CG demonstrating a robust effect of govorestat on clinically relevant neurobehavioral outcomes, histopathology, and metabolic markers of CG should be considered. For accelerated approval, strong mechanistic evidence for galactitol's role as the major mediator in CG pathogenesis, addressing alternative toxic mechanisms, and determining a galactitol reduction threshold predicting clinical benefit are needed.
